# About
Hello! I'm Bret, a developer and a lecturer of writing studies. I study the way people write, why they write, and how writing helps us learn and think about things. I've always been interested in digital technology, and recently I decided to start filling in the gaps in my knowledge of web development. 

Over the past few months, I've been on a quest to gain the skills of a full-stack developer. As of writing this, I'm focusing primarily on the front-end (building web sites with  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Gradually, I'll be turning this site into a portfolio as my skills develop. I've learned that I like coding—even the frustrating bits—and I'm going to lean into that. 

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via email: bret (dot) zawilski (at) gmail (dot) com.
