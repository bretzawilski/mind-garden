# Welcome to the Serendipity Machine

My name is Bret Zawilski, and I am an Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and Composition at Appalachian State University.

I also currently serve as an Associate Editor of Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy, and previously I served as the Editorial Assistant for College Composition and Communication. My research interests revolve around new media composition, multimodality, and the role of material awareness in the transfer of writing knowledge and practice.
