# Welcome to the Serendipity Machine

My name is Bret Zawilski, and I am an Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and Composition at Appalachian State University.

I also currently serve as an Associate Editor of Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy, and previously I served as the Editorial Assistant for College Composition and Communication. My research interests revolve around new media composition, multimodality, and the role of material awareness in the transfer of writing knowledge and practice.

# **Critical Skills for Finance & Accounting | Semester 2 | 2021**

Welcome to Critical Skills! This document is the ‘master’ module outline (also called a syllabus) for Semester 1 of Universal Critical Skills for Finance and Accounting students. This document is your map and guide to Semester 1 of the module. It contains **essential** information, and **you will need to return to this document frequently.** It contains:

- **Class goals and learning objectives**
- **The class schedule**
- **Links to assigned readings**
- **Links to assignments**
- **Overview of policies**
- **Information about supports and resources**
- **Contact details for Critical Skills staff**


# Class format, attendance and expectations

Due to the ongoing global pandemic, this module outline is subject to change.

As a result of the ongoing health crisis, this class will be taught online for the foreseeable future, and we will be using Online Lectures, Online Tutorials, and Online Group Meetings. Please see the graphic below for an outline of the semester. Also, please review the detailed schedule at the bottom of this page for more specific information regarding each week.

### Online **Lectures**

Online Lectures will take place on Class 1 of each week of the semester. We will be meeting through Microsoft Teams.

### **Online Tutorials**

Online tutorials with your Tutor will take place most weeks of Critical Skills. This semester we will be using Microsoft Teams as our primary space for tutorials. Check the schedule below for specific dates, and tutorial meetings should appear in your MS Teams Calendar as well. To encourage participation in these will have allocated 10% of the course marks for attendance in these online tutorials.

### Writing Time / Group Meetings

Because you will be working closely with your fellow classmates this term, a number of your class sessions will be devoted to Group Meetings where you will be asked to work on your major assignments for the semester. During this time, your Lecturer/Tutor will be available to provide help if needed, but you will be responsible for making progress on your major assignments and demonstrating that progress by keeping detailed meeting minutes.

![SK106%20Schedule%20and%20Syllabus%2035b07eb313054471bc447cf7f1e44879/SK106-Outline.png](SK106%20Schedule%20and%20Syllabus%2035b07eb313054471bc447cf7f1e44879/SK106-Outline.png)

### **Expectations and attendance**

This class relies on cooperative learning. The instructor and lecturers are facilitators and supporters of your learning, but you will have to take responsibility for your own learning. A passive approach to learning is not appropriate to an online class or to the learning goals of Critical Skills. You are going to be a ‘knowledge producer’ more than a ‘knowledge consumer’ in this class.

We think that a learning community is a group of people who share a common goal and support each other to achieve it. Furthermore, such a community recognizes that we are more than just ‘students’ or ‘instructors’--we are people living through a pandemic and all that entails. Support each other and be empathetic. See and understand that others’ circumstances are as complex as your own.

Additionally, this semester you will be engaging in rigorous collaborative work with other members of your class. You will need to be present for class sessions not just for your own sake, but for the benefit of your teammates as well.

### Attendance

Attendance will be recorded for Online Tutorials throughout the semester. Please be sure to prioritize attending these sessions. You will also be expected to attend collaborative group meetings with your teammates throughout much of the semester.

Attendance—physical or online—is directly correlated with better marks. [We have the data to prove it](https://maynoothuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/brian_mckenzie_mu_ie/EVhXHWnjiV1Dn-SMlUQxqHwBwu3s6KCDBqCY6mPGLcjOHQ?e=7ge9en):

![SK106%20Schedule%20and%20Syllabus%2035b07eb313054471bc447cf7f1e44879/attendance_scatterplot.png](SK106%20Schedule%20and%20Syllabus%2035b07eb313054471bc447cf7f1e44879/attendance_scatterplot.png)

## Learning objectives

Critical Skills is a class that aims to help your transition to university and develop key skills that are transferable across subjects and careers. Our goals for this class are that students will:

- **Develop advanced teamwork skills;**
- **Gain a basic understanding of how to assess statistical claims;**
- **Use Excel to analyze correlations and create a data visualization;**
- **Strengthen research, writing, and disciplinary skills by assuming the role of a subject matter expert and contributing to a formal White Paper report;**
- **Develop digital literacies and audience awareness by translating your White Paper into a podcast for a general audience**

# Contact details and consultation hours

Keep the channels of communication open! The email address for your instructor is on the Moodle page. They are your first port of call for questions about the class.

The class lecturer is Dr. Bret Zawilski ([bret.zawilski@mu.ie](mailto:bret.zawilski@mu.ie))

Gill Sheehy, the administrator of Critical Skills, can be reached at [criticalskills@mu.ie](mailto:criticalskills@mu.ie) 

Consultation hours are an important resource for students. Use them to meet one-on-one with your instructor to ask questions about the class, get extra help with assignments, or discuss any other academic topic. Your instructor will use either MS Teams or Zoom to host consultation hours. Check your class Moodle page for details. Bret will also host additional consultation hours.

Bret’s consultation hours are:

Thursdays 11:00 to 13:00 and by appointment (email to arrange to meet at a different time). These take place as a MS Teams meeting and you can use the following link to drop into the consultation hours.

[Bret's Consultation](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NTk1YjZlOGYtY2E5Zi00YWE4LWIxYjUtZTZkOThiMDE2OTk4%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221454f5cc-bb35-4685-bbd9-8621fd8055c9%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22d980b913-f58b-41e8-8f12-2fe5345f7f2a%22%7d) Meeting

## Email, Moodle, Microsoft Office, and Zoom

As a Maynooth student you have access to Office 365. You can access your university email in Outlook. Please use your official Maynooth University for all communication with staff. We are greatly limited in how we can reply to emails from other accounts.

Moodle is our Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). It’s another platform you’ll have to learn. Everything for a class will ‘live’ on its Moodle page, this syllabus for example. Importantly, you'll receive a generic email with 'Moodle announcements'. These will come up on your Moodle site and they will also come into your email each evening as 'Moodle digests.' Make sure you read these. If an instructor posts an announcement to Moodle it will show up in this email (and on the Moodle announcement forum). 

You will be able to access some of the class content using a smartphone. However, this is a writing intensive class so you will need access to hardware that will allow you to generate the required content. You should learn how to use Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Office has other useful tools like a calendar and a planner to help you get and stay organised.

## Supports

One of the challenges of online learning is the difficulty in accessing supports that would be readily at hand if you were on campus all the time. MU is working hard to support students even if it is not possible to be physically present on campus. The main COVID-19 page for the university is here: [https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/coronavirus](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/coronavirus)

- The [Student Help](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/studenthelp) page is a great place to start if you are facing challenges
- There is a consolidated page for Online Learning Support:
    - [https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/dean-teaching-learning/online-learning-student-supports-202021](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/dean-teaching-learning/online-learning-student-supports-202021)
- Another ‘official’ page from MU is here:
    - [https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/coronavirus/students](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/coronavirus/students)
- There is a [Student and University FAQ](https://maynoothuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/brian_mckenzie_mu_ie/ESaUsvpqxQtJjvjT7coP_MMB5u6q455Jy7pKgX4tFXX4Ug?e=dXf2yk).
- If you are having trouble with Moodle you can contact Moodle Support here: [moodlesupport@mailstage.mucampus.net](mailto:moodlesupport@mailstage.mucampus.net) ****
- For IT (but not Moodle) issues you can contact [servicedesk@mu.ie](mailto:servicedesk@mu.ie)
- [The Maynooth University Access Office](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/access-office) has a great collection of helpful resources.
- [The Maynooth University Counselling Centre](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/campus-life/student-wellbeing-support/counselling) is available to support students.
- You can access Maynooth University library resources when off campus. Indeed, over the coming year it will be essential that you do. [MU Library Guides & Tutorials](https://nuim.libguides.com/guides_tutorials)
- Finally, you should check out the [Enhancing Digital Teaching & Learning in Irish Universities](https://edtl.blog/) site. It has great tips from students:
    - [https://edtl.blog/the-edtl-approach/the-edtl-approach-for-students-by-students/](https://edtl.blog/the-edtl-approach/the-edtl-approach-for-students-by-students/)

# Academic Policies

Please review the [Maynooth University Rules and Regulations](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/university-policies/rules-regulations-students). These are still applicable for an online class. Pay careful attention to the MU Policy on Plagiarism as any instance of plagiarism in the team project will affect the marks of everyone on the team.

### **Late work**

Due dates are important. Scheduling your time and prioritising work is a key skill to master for academic and professional success. All of the assessments in this course have set due dates. Moodle provides a helpful reminder of upcoming due dates. In the absence of medical documentation no late submissions for these assignments will be accepted. If you have medical documentation please email your instructor within two weeks of the due date. Medical documentation will be used to credit attendance for missed classes if specific dates are indicated. As always, if you encounter extenuating circumstances, let your tutor and [Dr. Bret Zawilski](mailto:bret.zawilski@mu.ie) (bret.zawilski@mu.ie) know. We want to provide as much support as possible.

### Required Readings

The following texts are required reading this semester. Refer to individual weeks for specific reading assignments from these texts (click on a link to be brought to the reading through your MU MS Office account).
