# Welcome to bret.design
This page is a test-bed for code, with an attached blog and mind garden. What's a mind garden, you ask? Think of it like a personal wiki, where all the content is synthesized from what an individual watches or reads. It's connected to personal knowledge management (PKM) and the concept of the Zettelkasten. For more information, head over to the [Notes](https://bret.design/notes) for more information. 

This site is built with Eleventy, a fantastic static site generator with a low barrier for setup and a lot of flexibility. It's hosted through vercel, and I'll be working on a guide that walks through the setup.

## Wait, what is this?
In mid-April 2021, I started building my skills as a developer. I've known and worked with HTML and CSS for years, but always in a hobbyist capacity. In April, after enduring a year of lockdown and struggling to find some new meaning through a project, I found that something finally clicked with JavaScript and web development. That grew into an obsession with web development frameworks and even a desire to figure out what backend development entails. 

If those terms are still fuzzy to you, part of the purpose of this site is to help me grasp these concepts. I'm new, and while there's a lot to learn, I'm excited to dive into this.

## The Blog
The blog of this site will cover a variety of developer topics. I can't pretend that what I write will be shockingly different from other resources and guides out there. But, as a lecturer of writing in my day job, I know that learning and writing are initmately connected. There's a reason developer blogs feature in so many people's process. So if you're looking to become a developer, or just looking to understand the terminology, I'm going to try to make accessible and simple overviews. 

And yes, I know, I'm also going to have to ditch some of my academic tone. No one wants to read that.

### Learning and Resources
I'm a firm believer in the free access to educational content. And that depends upon the generous contributors to open source education projects. I have a conflicted relationship with the state of education (university, in particular), and that will likely come across in some of my articles. Education is intensely valuable, but like so much else, it's become commodified to an extent that is...depressing. 

Let's go.
