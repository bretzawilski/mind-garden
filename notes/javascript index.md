# JavaScript
This is it, the language that I've chosen to pursue first and most seriously in my career as a developer. This page will provide an index of materials that relate to vanilla JS concepts. It will not include direct references to individual frameworks.

## JS Concepts
- [[Thread of Execution]]
- [[Memory in Javascript]]
- [[Variable Types]]
- [[JS Functions]]
- [[DOM Manipulation]]
