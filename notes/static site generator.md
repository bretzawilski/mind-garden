# Static Site Generators
While Wordpress often functions as a dynamic web generator — in which the content is generated dynamically each time a user visits the site — static sites serve up standard html, css, and javascript files without requiring the server to generate websites from templates (normally PHP). Static sites are much more "lightweight" than dynamic sites and are suitable for content that is not meant to highlight a high degree of interactivity.
