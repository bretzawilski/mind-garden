# CSS Index
Cascading Style Sheets are a crucial part of web design and are responsible for much of the visual appearance of a website.

Thanks to more recent implementations like CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, design has become easier, but there is still a need for additional tools such as SASS or Tailwind CSS to provide increased functionality.
