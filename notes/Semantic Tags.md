# HTML Semantic Tags
Semantic tags are and HTML5 addition that provides for some additional descriptive syntax. Rather than only having access to `<div>` tags that can be assigned an identity via id or class properties, now we can have elements that are semantically named through their tags.

For example, `<nav>` tags create a div, but signal that content within the tag will be related to navigating the website. Similarly, the `<article>` tag is a div that signals its text is the main content of the webpage. 

There is mixed uptake of semantic tags, but I know that semantic tags are marketed as an aid to accessibility on the web, allowing screenreaders to better understand the content of each tag.
