After a late start, I decided to revisit my personal blog and mind garden site, since some of the typography decisions haven't been sitting well with me. I managed to make some small tweaks to the layout and get thigns looking a bit better, but it still feels amateur-ish. 

And it is. I know that I'm still rather new to this, and the site is meant to be a bit of a work in progress that I can build out over time.
